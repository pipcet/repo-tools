repo-tools
==========
Some very hackish Perl scripts to make life with Google's repo easier, or even possible.

It's probably best to assume this software is unmaintained and consider its creation
a mere educational exercise, but if you do happen to find it useful, that's great.

 - repo-log.pl
     print a combined log for all Git repositories that make up a repo repository.
 - repo-overlay.pl
     create an "overlay" tracking repository for an entire repo repository, so it can be committed as a single Git repository
